                    HTML forms the backbone of the web, providing the structure and organization for content. Composed
                    of tags that define elements on a webpage, HTML allows seamless integration of text, images, links,
                    and multimedia. As the fundamental language for creating web pages, HTML plays a pivotal role in
                    shaping the digital landscape, facilitating connectivity and information dissemination across the
                    internet.

                <article>
                    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the design language of the web, enhancing the visual presentation
                    of HTML elements. Through selectors and rules, CSS controls layout, colors, fonts, and spacing,
                    creating pleasing and responsive web pages. By enabling separation of content and style, CSS
                    simplifies maintenance and ensures consistent design across websites. It empowers developers to
                    customize the look and feel, delivering a polished user experience.

                    JavaScript, a client-side scripting language, powers dynamic web interactions. Executed by
                    browsers, it seamlessly integrates with HTML and CSS, enabling developers to create responsive and
                    interactive websites. From form validation to real-time updates, JavaScript's versatility plays a
                    crucial role in modern web development, contributing to the creation of engaging user experiences
                    across the digital landscape.
